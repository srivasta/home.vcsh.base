feature=$1
# rebases and merges $1 into the current branch
# git checkout $feature && git rebase @{-1} && git checkout @{-2} && git merge @{-1}

# The special "@{-n}" syntax means "n-th branch checked out before
# current one". When we checkout "feature", "@{-1}" is a reference to
# branch we were on (like, say, master)). After rebasing, we need to
# use "@{-2}" to checkout "master"" because "@{-1}" is a reference to
# the same branch ("feature") due to how rebasing works internally.

git rebase HEAD $feature && git rebase HEAD @{-2}
