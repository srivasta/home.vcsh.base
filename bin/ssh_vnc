ssh -C -f -g -L 11120:kenobee:5900 r2d2 sleep 10
xvncviewer -shared -encodings hextile localhost:11120

# On anakin:
# ssh -L 9900:flanders.internal.stdc.com:3389 10.1.0.10
# At Home
# ssh -L 9900:localhost:9900 anakin
# rdesktop -u root -p - -g 1024x768 -z -x l localhost:9900

# ssh commands may be chained. 

# dd if=pictures.tar.gz | ssh gateway "ssh internal \"dd of=pictures.tar.gz\""

# Port forwarding

# This is useful where your have your local machine outside a
# firewall; a gateway host on the DMZ; and a third machine invisible
# to the outside on the internal network providing services.

# Example: Connect your local POP port to the pop port on
# mailhost. Also do the same with the SMTP port. The mailhost is not
# directly visible from the outside.

# ssh -q -f -C -N -L 110:mailhost:110 -L 25:mailhost:25 -l user -N gatewayhost
#
# -N tells SSH we don't want to execute a remote command. Not terribly
#    necessary, but makes it safer.
# -C compress all data
#
# -f tells ssh to go into the background (daemonize).
#
# -q tells ssh to be quiet

# Use ssh as a sock proxy/server. Here, we take anythinfg sent to the
# localhost port 8080, an, depending on the protocol, connect to the
# remote host.

# ssh -D 8080 -f -C -q -N remote.host.com
#
# or use both:
# ssh -C -N -D 8080 -L 110:mailhost:110 -L 25:mailhost:25 -l user -N gatewayhost
#

# Forward the ssh port:

# Here is how to connect to, say, kamadhenu:
# ssh -f -C -N -L 8081:10.1.0.10:22 anakin.stdc.com
# ssh -p 8081 localhost

# You can set it up the other way around too: say, is you do not have
# a gateway, but do need to tunnel:
# work% ssh -f -C -N -R 2222:localhost:22 home.machine
#  (if you run your home sshd on, say, port 42424, add -p 42424 above)
#
# This assumes that you have something like this on your home machines
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# ...
# TCPKeepAlive yes
# ClientAliveInterval 30
# ClientAliveCountMax 99999
# ...
#
# If not, you need to remove the -f, log in to the home machine, and
# run ping -i 5 127.0.0.1, or something.
#
# now, go home.
# home% ssh -p 2222 localhost (and bang, you are in the firewall).
#
# Heck, if you open post 2222 at home for remote access, you can use
# you laptop from anywhere and say: ssh -p 2222 home.machine, and you
# have access from anyhere.
# You also need the following in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the home machine:
# ...
# GatewayPorts yes
# ...
#
# This makes it possible that forwarded ports on home machine can be reached
# from another host.

# Chained port forwarding

# If you have an super secure internal machine that only accepts ssh
# from another internal machine, and you have a gateway host, you can
# still see ports on the inner machine, For example, postgresql

# home% ssh -t -L 5432:localhost:1999 gateway \
#            ssh -t middle                    \
#            ssh -t super_secure              \
#       ssh -t -R 1999:127.0.0.1:5432 gateway
