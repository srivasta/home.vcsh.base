# Example configuration file for reportbug(1)
# Options can be specified in any order
# usually, no-OPTION will disable OPTION if OPTION is boolean

# Default severity level; will bypass prompt in reportbug, so disabled
# severity normal

# Submission address: default is 'submit'
submit
# Can also be 'quiet' or 'maintonly'; see --report-quiet and --maintonly
# entries on man page

# Mailer to use (default is empty, to use internal mailer). One of:
# mutt
# af
# mh
# nmh

# mua 'mutt -H'

# 'Priority' order of BTS mirrors: list a series of national domains
# in order of preference; the first one a particular BTS supports will
# be the one that's used.  Note that Debian is the only BTS with
# mirrors at the moment.  (Uncomment the following lines then reorder
# the mirror list.  MAKE SURE no-ldap IS SPECIFIED OR ELSE YOU WILL
# ALWAYS CONNECT TO THE U.S.!)
#
# This doesn't work for BTSes with a CGI root.  Just as well, since
# the mirrors don't keep up.

# mirror uk
# mirror de
# mirror nl
